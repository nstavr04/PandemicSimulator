			PANDEMIC SIMULATOR
			
 	INFECTION: Person -> Person | Different 
			   Ground -> Person | Percentages
			   
	INPUTS: Infection Chance (Person and Environment). 
			Amount of people.						  
			Space dimensions.
			TimeUnits of simulation.		  
			How long infection lasts on ground.		 
			Start infected people ( 1 by default).     
			
 	SPACE: 1x1 Boxes. Only 1 person in it					
		   People have random placement. (people <= boxes)  
		   
	PEOPLE MOVEMENT: Every TimeUnit a person has a percentage to move or not.
					 If he moves -> Random 8 moves around him.
					 If no other person is there.
	
	INFECTION PROCEDURE: Person -> Person ( Certain percentage if theyre in nearby boxes ).
						 A percentage of people is IMMUNE.
						 A percentage of people wears MASKS. ( Lower infection rate ).
						 Ground -> Person ( Percentage < than w/ person )
						 Person -> Ground (Chance to infect ground the longer he stays the more it increases)
						 Ground infection decays after some time.
						 
	TIME: All moves are run by a clock. ( 1 step = 1 min = 1 TimeUnit )
	
	OUTPUT - STATISTICS: A record of all the end results based on the given input parameters.
