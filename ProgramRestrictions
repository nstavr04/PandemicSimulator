	5) The X and Y coordinate for the i border of i area must be within circumference of the grid
		
	6) The area that you want the i border to teleport the human to. Must be an area different from the current one.
	
	7) The duration of the simulation must be a positive number.
		
	8) The number of humans of the simulation. Must not exceed the amount of cells on all grids combined.
	
	9) The starting number of infected humans for the simulation. Must be a positive number less or equal of the total amount of humans.
	
		
		
		
		
	1)	The environment has a lower chance of infecting the person than a person another person.
	
	2)	Infected people on the start of the program must be at least one and less or equal to all humans on the simulation.
	
	3)	People must be equal or less than the environment boxes and must be a positive number.
	
	4)	TimeUnits must be a positive number.
	
	5)	People cannot move on occupied nearby boxes.
	
	6)	All moves are coordinated by a single clock - timer.
	
	7)	All percentages given as arguments must be a positive number less or equal than 100.
